# Project TODO List - Codebase Improvement Plan

## Phase 1: Essential Code Organization (1-2 days)

### âœ… Completed
- [x] **Phase 1: Fix pyproject.toml dependencies** - Fixed ezomero version conflict to 3.1.1, cleaned up optional dependencies, added test and docs groups
- [x] **Phase 1: Migrate to src layout structure** - Moved package to modern src/omero_annotate_ai/ structure, updated pyproject.toml configuration, verified all imports work correctly
- [x] **Phase 1: Organize omero_functions.py** - Analysis shows current organization is optimal (no changes needed)
- [x] **Phase 1: Update imports after code reorganization** - All imports verified working correctly

## Phase 2: Robust CI/CD Pipeline (2-3 days)

### âœ… Completed
- [x] **Phase 2: Create GitHub Actions workflow for multi-platform CI/CD** - Comprehensive CI/CD with multi-platform testing, code quality checks, and automated PyPI publishing
- [x] **Phase 2: Configure test matrix for Python 3.8-3.12 on Ubuntu/Windows/macOS** - Full test matrix implemented with platform-specific optimizations
- [x] **Phase 2: Set up Docker-based OMERO testing** - Docker Compose setup following ezomero's proven approach for real OMERO server testing
- [x] **Phase 2: Create comprehensive test infrastructure** - Unit tests, integration tests, proper fixtures, and Makefile for easy development

## Phase 3: Automatic API Documentation (1-2 days)

### âœ… Completed
- [x] **Phase 3: Set up Sphinx for automatic API documentation generation** - Complete Sphinx setup with autodoc, Napoleon, and comprehensive API documentation
- [x] **Phase 3: Configure GitHub Pages deployment for documentation** - GitHub Actions workflow for automatic documentation deployment

## Phase 4: Enhanced Testing (1-2 days)

### âœ… Completed  
- [x] **Phase 4: Expand test suite with missing coverage areas** - Comprehensive test suite with unit and integration tests, proper fixtures and markers
- [x] **Phase 4: Add installation and widget functionality tests** - Integration tests cover OMERO connectivity, widget creation, and package functionality

### ðŸ”„ Remaining
- [ ] **Phase 4: Test in micro-sam conda environment** - Activate micro-sam environment and verify all tests pass with proper dependencies

## Notes

- Focus on keeping complexity manageable while ensuring professional-grade reliability
- Priority on your core requirements: API docs, multi-Python testing, multi-OS compatibility, CI/CD, unit tests
- Clean code organization following CLAUDE.md architectural guidelines

## Current Status: ðŸŽ‰ MAJOR PROGRESS ACHIEVED!

**Phases 1, 2, and 3 Complete!** The package now has:

âœ… **Modern Architecture**: src layout, clean organization, professional structure  
âœ… **Robust CI/CD**: Multi-platform testing, Docker OMERO integration, automated PyPI publishing  
âœ… **Professional Documentation**: Sphinx API docs, GitHub Pages deployment, comprehensive guides  
âœ… **Excellent Testing**: Unit tests, Docker-based integration tests, proper fixtures and markers  

## Next Session Goals

1. **Activate micro-sam conda environment and test package installation**
2. **Run full test suite in proper environment** 
3. **Consider Phase 5: First release preparation**
