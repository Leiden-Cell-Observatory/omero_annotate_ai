# Tutorial: BiaPy Integration

Learn how to train custom deep learning models using BiaPy with data prepared from OMERO annotations.

## Overview

BiaPy is a powerful framework for bioimage analysis. This tutorial demonstrates:

- Exporting OMERO annotations to BiaPy format
- Configuring BiaPy training pipelines
- Model training and validation
- Integrating trained models back into OMERO workflows

## Prerequisites

- BiaPy framework installed
- Training data prepared from OMERO annotations
- GPU access recommended for training

## Coming Soon

This tutorial is being developed. BiaPy integration provides deep learning capabilities for image segmentation and analysis workflows.
