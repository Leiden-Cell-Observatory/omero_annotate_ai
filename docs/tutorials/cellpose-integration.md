# Tutorial: Cellpose Integration

This tutorial demonstrates how to use Cellpose models within the OMERO Annotate AI framework for cell segmentation workflows.

## Overview

Cellpose is a powerful deep learning model for cell segmentation. This tutorial covers:

- Setting up Cellpose models in the annotation pipeline
- Configuring cell-specific segmentation parameters  
- Comparing Cellpose vs micro-SAM results
- Best practices for different cell types

## Prerequisites

- OMERO Annotate AI with Cellpose support installed
- Cell imaging data in OMERO
- Understanding of basic annotation workflows

## Coming Soon

This tutorial is under development. Cellpose integration provides powerful cell segmentation capabilities within the OMERO annotation pipeline.
