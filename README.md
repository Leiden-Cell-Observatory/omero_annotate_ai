# omero_annotate_ai

## Installation
For running the OMERO annotator tool micro_sam is required as a dependencies. However micro-sam is only installable via conda.   
So run `conda install -c conda-forge micro-sam` separately.

This package also depends on `ezomero` and `omero-py` , which depend on `zeroc-ice` , which is easier to install using a wheel from Glencoe software, which can be found [here](https://github.com/glencoesoftware/zeroc-ice-py-linux-x86_64/releases}, find the right wheel for your python version and OS.
